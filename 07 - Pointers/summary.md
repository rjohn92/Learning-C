## Lab 1: Pointer Declaration

1. **Questions:**
- What does `%p` print?
Answer: %p will print out the address of a variable
- Is the address always the same between runs? Why/why not?
Answer: The address will usually NOT be the same. Memory will change from run to run. So don't try to hardcode addresses.
