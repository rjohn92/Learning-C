# Comprehensive C Programming Syllabus (With CNO/RE Focus)

---

## Module 0: Getting Started With C
- What is C? History and context  
- Installing a compiler (`gcc`/`clang`) and setting up your environment  
- Writing, compiling, and running your first C program  
- Understanding errors, warnings, and compiler flags  
- Using the command line  
- Write simple hello_world.c

---

## Module 1: Basic Data Types and Variables
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `size_t`, etc.  
- Declaration, initialization, assignment  
- Scope and lifetime of variables  
- Constants (`const`, `#define`)  
- Type conversions and casting  

---

## Module 2: Operators and Expressions
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators  
- Precedence and associativity  
- Compound assignments and increment/decrement  
- Common C “gotchas” (integer promotion, precedence surprises)  

---

## Module 3: Conditionals
- `if`, `else if`, `else`  
- `switch` and `case`  
- Looping: `for`, `while`, `do...while`  
- `break`, `continue`, and `goto` (with “when/why to avoid goto”)  

---

## Module 4: Loops
- for loops, while loops, do-while loops

---
## Module 5: Functions
- Defining, declaring, and calling functions  
- Arguments and return values  
- Scope (local, global, static)  
- Recursion  
- Function pointers and callback basics (how they work, why they matter in CNO/RE)  

---
## Module 6: Pointers (Intro)
- Pointer basics: declaration, dereferencing, and address-of (`*`, `&`)  
- Pointers and arrays, pointer arithmetic  
- Double pointers (`int **`) and their uses  

## Module 7: Arrays and Strings
- Declaring and initializing arrays  
- Accessing/modifying array elements  
- Multi-dimensional arrays  
- Strings as arrays of characters (`char[]`, `char *`)  
- Standard library string functions (`strcpy`, `strlen`, `strcat`, etc.)  
- Common pitfalls: buffer overflows, off-by-one errors  

---

## Module 8: Pointers and Memory Management
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)  
- Memory leaks, dangling pointers, undefined behavior  
- Stack vs. heap memory: how C uses both, why it matters  

---

## Module 9: Structures and Data Organization
- Defining and using `struct`s  
- Struct pointers, nested structs, arrays of structs  
- Enums, unions (basics)  
- Organizing data for real-world programs  

---

## Module 10: File Input/Output and OS Interaction
- File pointers (`FILE *`)  
- Opening, reading, writing, and closing files (`fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`)  
- Command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`)  
- Environment variables (`getenv`, `setenv`)  
- Basic system calls (optional: `open`, `read`, `write`, `close` for Linux)  

---

## Module 11: Advanced CNO/RE-Specific Topics
- **The C Memory Model**: stack frames, heap, global/static, call stack, function prologue/epilogue  
- **Compiling and Inspecting Binaries**:  
    - Compiler flags: `-g`, `-O0` vs `-O2`, `-Wall`, etc.  
    - Disassembling with `objdump`, `ndisasm`  
    - Intro to reading compiler output in assembly (matching C lines to assembly)  
- **Debugging With GDB**:  
    - Breakpoints, watchpoints, single-stepping, backtraces  
    - Inspecting variables, memory, registers  
    - Patching variables at runtime  
- **Intro to Reverse Engineering Tools**:  
    - Loading programs in Ghidra  
    - Identifying functions, stack variables, and control flow in RE tools  
    - Recognizing compiler-generated patterns  
- **Classic C Vulnerabilities and Exploits**:  
    - Buffer overflows (stack/heap), off-by-one errors, format string bugs  
    - Use-after-free, double free, integer overflows/truncation  
    - How these look in both C code and compiled binaries  
- **Safe Coding Practices**: Defensive programming, using tools like `valgrind` and static analyzers  

---

## Module 12: Mini-Projects and Capstone
- Implement a small C project (chat server, calculator, file parser, etc.)  
- Document, debug, and “attack” your own code (try to break it, then fix the bugs)  
- Optional: Write intentionally vulnerable code, then find/exploit it  

---

## Module 13: Supplementary/Bonus Topics
- Multi-file projects and Makefiles  
- Intro to socket/network programming in C (TCP, UDP basics)  
- Simple concurrency (`fork`, basic threads)  
- Using and reading man pages, official docs  
- Using and contributing to open-source C projects  

---

## Practice/Challenges Throughout
- Weekly coding tasks, debugging exercises, and RE mini-challenges (look at binaries, write your own, find bugs)  
- “CTF-style” exercises: password checkers, simple crackmes, file format fuzzers  

---

**Tip:**  
Use this as a master checklist—mark modules and subtopics as you complete or review them.  
If you want granular exercise lists or code templates for any module, just ask!
