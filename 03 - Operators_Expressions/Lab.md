# Lab: Operators and Expressions (Requirements Only)

**Module:** 3 â€“ Operators and Expressions  
**Skill Level:** Beginner  
**Objective:** Demonstrate understanding of C operators, expressions, operator precedence, and common pitfalls, using only concepts learned so far.

---

## Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operators and Integer Division

- Create a new C source file.
- Declare two integer variables with different values.
- Calculate and print their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
- Repeat the calculations using at least one negative number.
- Write down your predicted results for division and modulus operations before running the code.

---

## Exercise 2: Comparison and Logical Operators

- Create a new C source file.
- Declare several integer variables and set them to different values.
- Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to compare the variables and print the results.
- Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) in expressions involving your variables, and print the results.
- Include at least one expression that combines more than one logical/comparison operator.

## Exercise 3: Operator Precedence and Parentheses

- Create a new C source file.
- Write several mathematical expressions that combine addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- For each expression, write a second version that uses parentheses to change the order of evaluation.
- Print the results of each expression, and explain any differences between the parenthesized and non-parenthesized results.

---

## Exercise 4: Bitwise Operators (Optional/Challenge)

- Create a new C source file.
- Declare two small unsigned integer variables.
- Use bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT to create and print new values based on your variables.
- Manually convert at least one result to binary and explain how the bitwise operation changed the value.

---

## Exercise 5: Classic C Gotchas

- Create a new C source file.
- Write code that demonstrates the difference between assignment (`=`) and equality (`==`) in a condition.
- Write an expression that stores the result of integer division in a float variable, and print the result.
- Demonstrate integer overflow by incrementing an integer variable beyond its maximum value and printing the results.

## Submission/Write-Up

- For each lab, explain your predictions, describe what happened when you ran the code, and answer any questions posed in the instructions.
- Save all your C source files and your write-up in your course folder or GitHub repo.
