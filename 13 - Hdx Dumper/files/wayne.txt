[Lil Wayne]\n
I am the beast\n
Feed me rappers or feed me beats\n
I am untamed, I need a leash\n
I am insane, I need a shrink\n
I love brain, I need a leech\n
Why complain on easy streets?\n
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak\n
and I like, my sprite easter pink\n
And my wrist special pah but the Mula's cooler\n
I have more jewels than your jeweler\n
Touch and I will bust your medulla\n
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor\n
Red light! Red light! Stop your rumors\n
I stay on track like a box of Pumas\n
Now just r-r-rock with Junior\n
I am the little big Kahuna, y'dig?\n
